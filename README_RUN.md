Hospital Management System - Ready to Run
----------------------------------------
This package was prepared by ChatGPT to include images and database so you can run it locally.

How to run (Windows / Linux / macOS):
1. Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.
2. Open a terminal and change directory to this project folder:
   cd "/mnt/data/Hospital_Management_System_Final_ready/Hospital_Management_System_Final (1)"
3. Run the app:
   python main.py

Notes:
- A local SQLite database `hospital.db` is included in this folder.
- Default credentials: username: admin  password: admin
- If you want to reset the database, delete `hospital.db` and restart the app; a fresh DB will be created.
